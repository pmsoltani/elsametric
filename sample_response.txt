In this research an AZ31 magnesium alloy was subjected to ECAR. The temperature of process was controlled before each passes. To maximize the grain refinement efficiency with preventing cracking the initial passes were carried out at higher temperature than the later passes. Observation of optical microstructure confirmed refinement of grains during the process. The distribution of grains was become narrower by increasing number of passes. After 10 passes of process significant grain refinement was occurred and the grains about 40 nm were achieved in grain boundaries of previous larger grains. Formation of nanograin structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) showed the rotation of basal plane after ECAR, this trend caused to better ductility of specimens which was clearly shown in stress-strain curves. Mechanical properties were studied by tensile and hardness tests at room temperature. After ECAR the yield stresses (YS) of the ECARed AZ31 alloys decreased while their elongation to failure increased which could be attributed to smaller grain size and easier slip because of texture modification. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/39261530900","authid":"39261530900","authname":"Hassani-Jabali F.","surname":"Hassani-Jabali","given-name":"Fatemeh Zahra","initials":"F.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16175217900","authid":"16175217900","authname":"Ketabchi M.","surname":"Ketabchi","given-name":"Mostafa","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Equal channel angular rolling | magnesium alloy | Nano-grain | Non-basal plane","source-id":"26916","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855349842"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855349842?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855349842&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855349842&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855349842","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84855349842","eid":"2-s2.0-84855349842","dc:title":"HVD: Horizontal-vertical-diagonal error detecting and correcting code to protect against with soft errors","dc:creator":"Kishani M.","prism:publicationName":"Design Automation for Embedded Systems","prism:issn":"09295585","prism:eIssn":"15728080","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"3-4","prism:pageRange":"289-310","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10617-011-9078-2","dc:description":"This paper presents a high level error detection and correction method called HVD code to tolerate multiple bit upsets (MBUs) occurred in memory cells. The proposed method uses parity codes in four directions in a data part to assure the reliability of memories. The proposed method is very powerful in error detection while its error correction coverage is also acceptable considering its low computing latency. HVD code is useful for applications whose high error detection coverage is very important such as memory systems. Of course, this code can be used in combination with other protection codes which have high correction coverage and low detection coverage. The proposed method is evaluated using more than one billion multiple fault injection experiments. Multiple bit flips were randomly injected in different segments of a memory system and the fault detection and correction coverages are calculated. Results show that 100% of the injected faults can be detected. We proved that, this method can correct up to three bit upsets.

Examples can be found in internal connecting elements of spacecraft and aerospace structures subjected to edge axial and shear loads. Designation of such elements is function of layup configuration, plate aspect ratio, loading combinations, and layup thickness. An optimum design aims maximum stability load satisfying a predefined stable vibration frequency. The interaction between compound loading and layup angle parameter affects the order of merging vibration modes and may stabilize the dynamic response. Laminated plates are assumed to be angle-plies symmetric to mid-plane surface. Dynamic equilibrium PDE has been solved using kernel integral transformation for modal frequency values and eigenvalue-based orthogonal functions for critical stability loads. The dictating dynamic stability mode is shown to be controlled by geometric stiffness distributions of composite plates. Solution of presented design optimization problem has been done using analytical approach combined with interior penalty multiplier algorithm. The results are verified by FEA approach and stability zones of original and optimized plates are stated as final data. Presented method can help designers to stabilize the dynamic response of composite plates by selecting an optimized layup orientation and thickness for prescribed design circumstances. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35321494400","authid":"35321494400","authname":"Shafei E.","surname":"Shafei","given-name":"Erfan","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101928284","authid":"7101928284","authname":"Kabir M.","surname":"Kabir","given-name":"Mohammad Zaman","initials":"M.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytical method | Dynamic stability | FEA | Laminated composite | Load combination | Optimization","source-id":"20498","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84555206669"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84555206669?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84555206669&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84555206669&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84555206669","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84555206669","eid":"2-s2.0-84555206669","dc:title":"An efficient method for finger-knuckle-print recognition by using the information fusion at different levels","dc:creator":"Shariatmadar Z.","prism:publicationName":"2011 International Conference on Hand-Based Biometrics, ICHB 2011 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457704901"}],"prism:pageRange":"216-221","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICHB.2011.6094325","dc:description":"Information fusion of various biometrics has attracted much attention in recent years. So in this paper we fused the information of biometrics in two different aspects. At the first, we investigate the information fusion in single modal, that is, the FKP biometric. FKP is one of the newest biometrics identifier which is recently used for personal identity authentication. For fusing the information of each FKP, two different representation of each image is used (Gray-level intensity and its Gabor transform). On the other hand, two different subsets of feature vectors are extracted from each image. At the second stage, the information of each finger at two different fusion levels is fused: feature and matching score level. In fact this algorithm works as a kind of multi-modal method with a single biometric characteristic but multiple units. By using the fusion rules in different levels, the recognition rate can improve significantly. For example, by combining the features of four fingers, the recognition rate will be obtained 96.56% and 92% at feature and matching score levels, respectively.

For efficiency several of those reservoirs often share the same surface processing. Most gas lift well networks confront the limitations on both gas supply and compressor capacity. Thus, allocating simultaneously a number of the wells the optimums of the gas injection rate and also the gas injection depth to reach the maximum oil production, in addition to satisfying the stated constraints, is the most important effort for the design process. This novel approach is a modification of the conventional allocation optimization problem in which no constraint was considered on the gas injection pressure at the surface. In this work, a model using the \"Particle Swarm Optimization\" algorithm and the \"Penalty Function\" method is presented to solve the new approach of the allocation optimization problem with a high speed and desirable accuracy. Then, the model is tested on a group of wells. © 2011 URBAN-VERLAG Hamburg/Wien GmbH.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Trade Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57003072600","authid":"57003072600","authname":"Rasouli H.","surname":"Rasouli","given-name":"H.","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003923795","authid":"7003923795","authname":"Rashidi F.","surname":"Rashidi","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26657370700","authid":"26657370700","authname":"Khamehchi E.","surname":"Khamehchi","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"source-id":"18234","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655172514"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655172514?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655172514&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655172514&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655172514","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83655172514","eid":"2-s2.0-83655172514","dc:title":"An improved solution to capillary rise of water in soils","dc:creator":"Aghajani H.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Civil Engineering","prism:issn":"17350522","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"275-281","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","dc:description":"Evaluating the rate and maximum height of capillary rise is of prime interest in unsaturated soil mechanics. Antecedent solutions to this problem have dwelled mostly on determining the maximum capillary rise height, overlooking moisture and suction changes in the capillary region. A comprehensive improved solution for the capillary rise of water in soils is presented. Salient features of the formulation including; consideration of initial soil suction (if any) prior to capillary rise, and determination of water content variation in the capillary region are elaborately discussed. Results reveal that suction head variation within the capillary region is non-linear, where the curvature decreases as water rises to higher elevations. The solution is verified and compared with existing solutions, by means of two sets of experimental data available in the literature. The comparison suggests that the improved formulation is more accurate and versatile than previous solutions for capillary rise.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54782119400","authid":"54782119400","authname":"Aghajani H.","surname":"Aghajani","given-name":"Hamed Farshbaf","initials":"H.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8668655400","authid":"8668655400","authname":"Soroush A.","surname":"Soroush","given-name":"Abbas","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25823400900","authid":"25823400900","authname":"Shourijeh P.","surname":"Shourijeh","given-name":"Piltan Tabatabaie","initials":"P.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Capillary rising | Suction | Unsaturated soils | Unsaturated transient seepage","source-id":"17700156604","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83555172261"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83555172261?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83555172261&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83555172261&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83555172261","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83555172261","eid":"2-s2.0-83555172261","dc:title":"A material selection methodology and expert system for sustainable product design","dc:creator":"Zarandi M.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","prism:issn":"02683768","prism:eIssn":"14333015","prism:volume":"57","prism:issueIdentifier":"9-12","prism:pageRange":"885-903","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00170-011-3362-y","dc:description":"Material selection is one of the main phases of product design process that has great impact on the manufacturing of sustainable products. One of the best approaches of material selection for sustainable products is life cycle engineering (LCE). But LCE is a costly and cumbersome task and it is not economic to perform this task for a large number of proposed materials in order to choose the most suitable one for a sustainable product. Instead, it is more reasonable to make a preliminary filtering on the proposed materials and obtain a shorter list of candidate materials and then perform LCE on alternatives which are obtained from preliminary filtering. Since environmental friendliness of materials is a critical sustainability issue, so it is a good criterion for preliminary filtering of alternatives. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to support preliminary filtering of alternatives from environmental viewpoint. The methodology uses the knowledge of experts in the field of eco-design. The knowledge is translated to decision making rules and a decision tree is developed to guide the choice. In order to use the capabilities of frame-based systems, an object-oriented approach for representation of knowledge is also proposed. Moreover, a prototype hybrid expert system based on the proposed methodology called material selection expert system for sustainable product design is developed to support the task of preliminary filtering. Finally, a case study from tire manufacturing industries is presented to show the validity of the proposed system. The results show that the system can determine the appropriate candidate materials and hence improve the possibility of manufacturing of more sustainable products. Eliminating alternatives that do not have the necessary conditions for sustainable product leads to a large saving in time and cost of the LCE evaluation process © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","citedby-count":"39","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55663148000","authid":"55663148000","authname":"Zarandi M.","surname":"Zarandi","given-name":"Mohammad Hosein Fazel","initials":"M.H.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193678782","authid":"57193678782","authname":"Mansour S.","surname":"Mansour","given-name":"Saeid","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37121908000","authid":"37121908000","authname":"Hosseinijou S.","surname":"Hosseinijou","given-name":"Seid Ali","initials":"S.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35104376100","authid":"35104376100","authname":"Avazbeigi M.","surname":"Avazbeigi","given-name":"Milad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Life cycle engineering | Material selection | Rule-based expert system | Sustainable product design","source-id":"20428","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455223635"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455223635?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455223635&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455223635&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455223635","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83455223635","eid":"2-s2.0-83455223635","dc:title":"Experimental and numerical investigation of damaged concrete beams strengthened with FRP composed of different fibres and resins","dc:creator":"Rahai A.","prism:publicationName":"Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings","prism:issn":"15417794","prism:eIssn":"15417808","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"972-985","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1002/tal.570","dc:description":"Strengthening of structures to avoid further damages is inevitable in different conditions.

However, NSP is restricted to only a single mode response, thus this is appropriate for low-rise buildings in which the behaviour is dominated by the first vibration mode. The use of FEMA force distributions has certain flaws when high-rise buildings are evaluated; since the seismic demands are greatly underestimated especially at top stories of tall buildings.Hence, in this paper a new pushover procedure is proposed with takes into account higher mode effects. The procedure utilizes consecutive modal pushover (CMP) analyses using mode shapes obtained from a linear elastic analysis of the structure. The methodology is applied to three Reinforced Concrete frames with shear walls. It is demonstrated that the CMP procedure is able to estimate the seismic demands accurately enough and to overcome the shortcomings of FEMA load distributions when the higher mode effects are significant. Plastic hinge rotations are noticeably improved by this procedure when compared with those obtained by the MPA procedure and FEMA load distributions.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53866507700","authid":"53866507700","authname":"Faramarz K.","surname":"Faramarz","given-name":"Khoshnoudian","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54789830700","authid":"54789830700","authname":"Mehdi K.","surname":"Mehdi","given-name":"Kafaeikivi","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"consecutive modal pushover (CMP) | higher mode effects | nonlinear response history analysis | seismic demands | tall buildings","source-id":"14469","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82955167936"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82955167936?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82955167936&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82955167936&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82955167936","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:82955167936","eid":"2-s2.0-82955167936","dc:title":"Scour depth at bridge abutments protected with a guide wall","dc:creator":"Fathi A.","prism:publicationName":"Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering","prism:issn":"03151468","prism:eIssn":"12086029","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1347-1354","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1139/L11-096","dc:description":"An experimental study of scour development at abutments protected with a guide wall was carried out. Five types of guide walls were installed at a bridge constriction in a movable bed model and their efficiency for scour reduction at the bridge section was studied. Experiments were conducted at the threshold of bed material motion. Uniform bed material was used and tests were conducted at different conveyed discharges. Experiments showed that the short wing wall had the minimum and the long elliptic wall had the maximum efficiency in scour reduction. These guide walls reduced the scour depth at bridge section by 45% and 60% compared with a vertical unprotected abutment, respectively. The location of the maximum scour depth along the guide walls depended on their shape. Based on experimental results an empirical method was developed to calculate the scour depth at the bridge section. The depth of the scour hole at the guide walls nose is also studied.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201832029","authid":"57201832029","authname":"Fathi A.","surname":"Fathi","given-name":"Ali","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602922110","authid":"6602922110","authname":"Zarrati A.","surname":"Zarrati","given-name":"Amir Reza","initials":"A.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54421100900","authid":"54421100900","authname":"Salamatian S.","surname":"Salamatian","given-name":"S.

One of these decisions is selecting the appropriate policy for service distribution of the whole network. The method of service distribution in the network is uniform by default. Therefore there may be some nodes in the network that provide service and there is less or no demand for them. So, based on the default attitude, energy and power consumption are high and since WSN are sensitive to the energy and power consumption, this is undesirable. In this study, a self-organised system for service placement and substitution in WSN is presented. By utilising this method, nodes can act automatically in delivering a service. Therefore the nodes that have no service request will be automatically omitted in the network. By utilising the proposed method of this study, the energy and power consumption of a wireless sensor network can be reduced by more than a half. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35772445500","authid":"35772445500","authname":"Asghari S.","surname":"Asghari","given-name":"S.

In high-order discretization the boundary elements are interpolated with some polynomial functions. These polynomials are employed to provide higher degrees of continuity for the geometry of boundary elements, and also they are used as interpolation functions for the variables located on the boundary elements. The main aim of this paper is to improve the accuracy of the high-order discretization in the two-dimensional BEM. In the high-order discretization, both the geometry and the variables of the boundary elements are interpolated with the polynomial function Pm, where m denotes the degree of the polynomial. In the current paper we will prove that if the geometry of the boundary elements is interpolated with the polynomial function Pm+1 instead of Pm, the accuracy of the results increases significantly. The analytical results presented in this work show that employing the new approach, the order of convergence increases from O(L0) m to O(L0)m+1 without using more CPU time where L0 is the length of the longest boundary element. The theoretical results are also confirmed by some numerical experiments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this method, the displacements of the graphite electrodes regulating arc voltages are controlled using instant values of inductances at the secondary side of the EAF in three phases. For on-line estimation of inductance values, an artificial neural network is trained, using a random set of data obtained from an appropriate inductance simulator. The performance of the proposed method is examined by comparing the thermal energy efficiency of a typical EAF for two control schemes, namely, constant and varying flexible cable inductances.

But chaotic dynamics beyond the stable region has not been considered extensively. Moreover, modeling issues for chaotic motion need more challenge for accurate prediction of its complex dynamical behavior. This paper presents a detailed two-degree-of-freedom mechanics based model for the study of chaotic vibrations in milling. Segmental multiple regenerative effect that is the principle feature of nonlinear vibrations in milling processes besides two state dependent time delays has been considered. Exact geometrical formulation of multiple regenerative effects by considering simultaneously different numbers of delayed tool positions over the cutting zone is presented for the first time. Phase portrait, bifurcation diagram, largest Lyapunov exponent, and surface profile were calculated for a given machine tool and workpiece parameters. The simulation results show positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponent corresponding to the existence of chaos in high-speed milling operations. Also, investigation of the machined surface of the workpiece formed by the helical mill demonstrates an irregular pattern on the surface. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36801187900","authid":"36801187900","authname":"Banihasan M.","surname":"Banihasan","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602930022","authid":"6602930022","authname":"Bakhtiari-Nejad F.","surname":"Bakhtiari-Nejad","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chaotic vibrations | Helical mill | Multiple regenerative | State dependent delay | Surface profile","source-id":"21576","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81955163099"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81955163099?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=81955163099&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=81955163099&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81955163099","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:81955163099","eid":"2-s2.0-81955163099","dc:title":"Dynamic analysis of functionally graded plates using the hybrid Fourier-Laplace transform under thermomechanical loading","dc:creator":"Akbarzadeh A.","prism:publicationName":"Meccanica","prism:issn":"00256455","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1373-1392","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11012-010-9397-6","dc:description":"In this study, the analytical solution is presented for dynamic response of a simply supported functionally graded rectangular plate subjected to a lateral thermomechanical loading. The first-order and third-order shear deformation theories and the hybrid Fourier-Laplace transform method are used. The material properties of the plate, except Poisson's ratio, are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a power-law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. The plate is subjected to a heat flux on the bottom surface and convection on the upper surface. A third-order polynomial temperature profile is considered across the plate thickness with unknown constants. The constants are obtained by substituting the profile into the energy equation and applying the Galerkin method. The obtained temperature profile is considered along with the equations of motion. The governing partial differential equations are solved using the finite Fourier transformation method. Using the Laplace transform, the unknown variables are obtained in the Laplace domain. Applying the analytical Laplace inverse method, the solution in the time domain is derived. The computed results for static, free vibration, and dynamic problems are presented for different power law indices for a plate with simply supported boundary conditions. The results are validated with the known data reported in the literature. Furthermore, the results calculated by the analytical Laplace inversion method are compared with those obtained by the numerical Newmark method. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36678764300","authid":"36678764300","authname":"Akbarzadeh A.","surname":"Akbarzadeh","given-name":"A.

Miniemulsion polymerization was used for its abundant advantages to encapsulate inorganic materials and eliminate organic solvents from products for environmentally friendly purposes. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant, which is an effective surfactant at higher temperatures, was used to stabilize the miniemulsion system. Successful miniemulsion AGET ATRP was carried out by using 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dNbPy) as a hydrophobic ligand. Formation of monodispersed droplets and particles with sizes in the range of 200nm was examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Conversion and molecular weight study were also carried out using gravimetry and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. By adding clay content, a decrease in the conversion and molecular weight of the nanocomposites are observed. However, an increase in the PDI values of nanocomposites was observed by the addition of nanoclay content. Thermogravimetric analysis results demonstrate that thermal stability of all the nanocomposites in comparison with the neat copolymer increases. Differential scanning calorimetry results show that Tg decreases by increasing clay content. Monodisperse distribution of spherical shape particles with sizes in the range of ∼ 200 nm was demonstrated by using scanning electron microscopy images of nanocomposite containing 1 wt% of nanoclay, which is more compiled with DLS results. Transmission electron microscopy results shows well-dispersed exfoliated clay layers in the polymer matrix of PSMNM 1, which is coincidence with X-ray diffraction data. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53877826100","authid":"53877826100","authname":"Khezri K.","surname":"Khezri","given-name":"Khezrollah","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603941909","authid":"6603941909","authname":"Haddadi-Asl V.","surname":"Haddadi-Asl","given-name":"Vahid","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36105452700","authid":"36105452700","authname":"Roghani-Mamaqani H.","surname":"Roghani-Mamaqani","given-name":"Hossein","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23467796000","authid":"23467796000","authname":"Salami-Kalajahi M.","surname":"Salami-Kalajahi","given-name":"Mehdi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"source-id":"14433","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80855140758"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80855140758?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80855140758&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80855140758&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80855140758","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80855140758","eid":"2-s2.0-80855140758","dc:title":"Hydrodynamic efficiency improvement of the High Skew Propeller for the underwater vehicle under surface and submerged conditions","dc:creator":"Ghassemi H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Ocean University of China","prism:issn":"16725182","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"314-324","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11802-011-1797-2","dc:description":"An algorithm based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM) is presented for designing the High Skew Propeller (HSP) used in an Underwater Vehicle (UV). Since UVs operate under two different kinds of working conditions (i. e. surface and submerged conditions), the design of such a propeller is an unwieldy task. This is mainly due to the fact that the resistance forces as well as the vessel efficiency under these conditions are significantly different. Therefore, some factors are necessary for the design of the optimum propeller to utilize the power under the mentioned conditions. The design objectives of the optimum propeller are to obtain the highest possible thrust and efficiency with the minimum torque. For the current UV, the main dimensions of the propeller are predicted based on the given required thrust and the defined operating conditions. These dimensions (number of blades, pitch, diameter, expanded area ratio, thickness and camber) are determined through iterative procedure. Because the propeller operates at the stern of the UV where the inflow velocity to the propeller is non-uniform, a 5-blade HSP is preferred for running the UV. Finally, the propeller is designed based on the numerical calculations to acquire the improved hydrodynamic efficiency. © 2011 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23008523400","authid":"23008523400","authname":"Ghassemi H.","surname":"Ghassemi","given-name":"Hassan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506461473","authid":"6506461473","authname":"Ghadimi P.","surname":"Ghadimi","given-name":"Parviz","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"high skew propeller | hydrodynamic propeller efficiency | propeller design factors | surface and submerged conditions | underwater vehicle","source-id":"6100153107","fund-acr":"AUT","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Amirkabir University of Technology","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80155174789"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80155174789?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80155174789&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80155174789&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80155174789","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80155174789","eid":"2-s2.0-80155174789","dc:title":"Weak module amenability of triangular Banach algebras","dc:creator":"Pourabbas A.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematica Slovaca","prism:issn":"01399918","prism:eIssn":"13372211","prism:volume":"61","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"949-958","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.2478/s12175-011-0061-y","dc:description":"Let A and B be unital Banach algebras and let M be a unital Banach A,B-module.

The problem to be studied has two main stages: In stage one, there are g stations and in station k, there are m1k identical parallel machines and in stage two, there is a station with m2 identical parallel machines. The first stage is a reentrant shop which all jobs have the same routing over the machines of the shop and the same sequence is traversed several times to complete different levels of the jobs. Such scheduling problems occur in certain practical applications such as semiconductors, electronics manufacturing, airplane engine production, and petrochemical production. The criterion is to minimize the makespan of the system. Setup times are implemented between jobs in both stages and between levels in stage one. There has not been any study about this real area which has two separated stages with different setup times in each one. Because of the intractability of the reentrant hybrid flow shop model, some heuristic algorithms and a random key genetic algorithm (RKGA) are proposed and compared with a new hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA).
