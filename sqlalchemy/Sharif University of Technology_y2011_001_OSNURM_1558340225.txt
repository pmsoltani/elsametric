Important results have been found, with respect to the Relative Gain Array (RGA). However, less has been done on the treatment of the integrity of uncertain systems. This paper builds on the more-recent progress on the analysis of uncertain systems and presents new conditions for the integrity of closed-loop systems. The developed Integral Controllable (IC), Integral Controllable with Integrity (ICI), and Decentralized Integral Controllability (DIC) conditions are derived using a model of uncertainties that allows both unstructured and structured independent uncertainties to be studied. A convex framework for the evaluation of the conditions is also presented. The utility of the conditions are illustrated through application to existing examples from the literature. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54782457900","authid":"54782457900","authname":"Firouzbahrami M.","surname":"Firouzbahrami","given-name":"Majid","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8713049500","authid":"8713049500","authname":"Nobakhti A.","surname":"Nobakhti","given-name":"Amin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"source-id":"13057","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655164916"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655164916?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655164916&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655164916&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655164916","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83655164916","eid":"2-s2.0-83655164916","dc:title":"Multiple access channel with correlated channel states and cooperating encoders","dc:creator":"Zamanighomi M.","prism:publicationName":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop, ITW 2011","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457704376"}],"prism:pageRange":"628-632","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089573","dc:description":"In this paper, a two-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DM-MAC) with correlated channel states, each known at one of the encoders is considered, in which each encoder transmits independent messages and tries to cooperate with the other one. To consider cooperating encoders, it is assumed that each encoder strictly-causally receives and learns the other encoder's transmitted symbols and tries to cooperate with the other encoder by transmitting its message. Next, we study this channel in a special case; we assume that the common part of both states is known at both, hence encoders use this opportunity to get better rate region. For these scenarios, an achievable rate region is derived based on a combination of block-Markov encoding and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding techniques. Furthermore, the achievable rate region is established for the Gaussian channel, and it is shown that the capacity region is achieved in certain circumstances. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53867656100","authid":"53867656100","authname":"Zamanighomi M.","surname":"Zamanighomi","given-name":"Mahdi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8645328900","authid":"8645328900","authname":"Emadi M.","surname":"Emadi","given-name":"Mohammad Javad","initials":"M.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53866176000","authid":"53866176000","authname":"Chaharsooghi F.","surname":"Chaharsooghi","given-name":"Farhad Shirani","initials":"F.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003626366","authid":"7003626366","authname":"Aref M.","surname":"Aref","given-name":"Mohammad Reza","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"article-number":"6089573","source-id":"20900195108","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655193057"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655193057?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655193057&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83655193057&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83655193057","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83655193057","eid":"2-s2.0-83655193057","dc:title":"An algorithmic approach for finding deletion correcting codes","dc:creator":"Khajouei F.","prism:publicationName":"2011 IEEE Information Theory Workshop, ITW 2011","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457704376"}],"prism:pageRange":"25-29","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ITW.2011.6089432","dc:description":"A general construction for deletion/insertion correcting codes is proposed by concatenating codes derived from a heuristic maximal independent set algorithm on an appropriately defined graph.

In this model m nodes of the network are observing i.i.d. repetitions of X (1), X (2),⋯, X (m) distributed according to q(x (1),⋯, x (m)). Given a joint distribution q(x (1),⋯,x (m), y (1), ⋯, y (m)), the final goal of the i th node is to construct the i.i.d. copies of Y (i) after the communication over the network where X (1), X (2),⋯, X (m), Y (1), Y (2),⋯, Y (m) are jointly distributed according to q(x (1), , x (m), y (1),⋯,y (m)). To do this, the nodes can exchange messages over the network at rates not exceeding the capacity constraints of the links. This problem is difficult to solve even for the special case of two nodes.

Based on the identified illumination category, a quadratic model is used to reconstruct an image that will visually be under normal illumination. In order to avoid the effect of light source intensity on face images, we used HE method. Experimental results show that, by using our enhanced algorithm for lighting compensation, the face recognition rate using principal component analysis can be improved to 98.91%. © 2011 University of Zagreb.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54683369000","authid":"54683369000","authname":"Ahmadi A.","surname":"Ahmadi","given-name":"Amir Hossein","initials":"A.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602638741","authid":"6602638741","authname":"Jamzad M.","surname":"Jamzad","given-name":"Mansour","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face recognition | Illumination compensation | least square method | Quadratic curve","article-number":"6046631","source-id":"20700195033","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455165063"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455165063?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455165063&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455165063&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455165063","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83455165063","eid":"2-s2.0-83455165063","dc:title":"Large-scale image annotation using prototype-based models","dc:creator":"Amiri S.","prism:publicationName":"ISPA 2011 - 7th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789531841597"}],"prism:pageRange":"449-454","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","dc:description":"Automatic image annotation is a challenging problem in the field of image retrieval. Dealing with large databases makes the annotation problem more difficult and therefore an effective approach is needed to manage such databases. In this work, an annotation system has been developed which considers images in separate categories and constructs a profiling model for each category. To describe an image, we propose a new feature extraction method based on color and texture information that describes image content using discrete distribution signatures. Image signatures of one category are partitioned using spectral clustering and a prototype is determined for each cluster by solving an optimization problem. The final model of one category will be constructed based on its prototypes in a generative modeling framework. To study the accuracy of the proposed approach, a large amount of pictures from a standard dataset are used for experiment. The results reveal that our system outperforms other methods which follow the same structure as the proposed approach. © 2011 University of Zagreb.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197243231","authid":"57197243231","authname":"Amiri S.","surname":"Amiri","given-name":"S.

Extraction of dominant segments with large number of pixels is essential for some applications such as object detection. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for color image segmentation which uses ideas behind the social science and complex networks to find dominant segments. At first, we extract the color and texture information for each pixel of input image. A network that consists of some nodes and edges is constructed based on the extracted information. The idea of community detection in social networks is used to partition a color image into disjoint segments. Community detection means partitioning vertices of a network into different non-overlapped groups (communities) such that the density of intra-group edges is much higher than the density of intergroup edges. There is a very close relation between communities in the social network and segments in an image. Our results show that community detection approaches will improve the segmentation output compare to other methods available in the literature. © 2011 University of Zagreb.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197243231","authid":"57197243231","authname":"Amiri S.","surname":"Amiri","given-name":"S.

While PCM cell size is marching towards minimum achievable feature size, recent prototypes effectively improve device scalability by storing multiple bits per each cell. Unfortunately, Multi-Level Cell (MLC) PCM devices offer higher access time and energy when compared to Single-Level Cell (SLC) counterparts making it difficult to incorporate MLC in main memory. To address this challenge, we proposes Zero-value-based Morphable PCM, ZM-PCM for short, a novel MLC-PCM main memory architecture which tries incorporating benefits of both MLC and SLC devices within the same structure. ZM-PCM relies on the observation that zero value at various granularities is frequently occurred within main memory transactions when running PARSEC-2 programs. Motivated by this observation, ZM-PCM codes redundant zero MLC cells into limited bits that is storable in the SLC (or alternatively in devices with fewer bits) form with improved latency, energy, and lifetime with no reduction in available main memory capacity. We evaluate microarchitecture design of morphable PCM cell, coding and decoding algorithms and details of related circuits. We also introduce a simple area-efficient caching mechanism for fast cost-efficient access to coding metadata. Our evaluation on a quad-core CMP with 4GB 8-bit MLC PCM main memory shows that ZM-PCM morphs up to 93% (and 50% on average) of all memory cells with lower densities which directly turns in performance, power and lifetime enhancement. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017853","afid":"60017853","affilname":"Iranian Research Institute for Fundamental Sciences","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26648114300","authid":"26648114300","authname":"Arjomand M.","surname":"Arjomand","given-name":"Mohammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017853"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/50261865200","authid":"50261865200","authname":"Jadidi A.","surname":"Jadidi","given-name":"Amin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36706440000","authid":"36706440000","authname":"Shafiee A.","surname":"Shafiee","given-name":"Ali","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017853"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56231405200","authid":"56231405200","authname":"Sarbazi-Azad H.","surname":"Sarbazi-Azad","given-name":"Hamid","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017853"}]}],"authkeywords":"Low power | Memory lifetime | PCM main memory | Zero-extended value","article-number":"6081426","source-id":"26669","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455201432"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455201432?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455201432&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83455201432&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83455201432","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:83455201432","eid":"2-s2.0-83455201432","dc:title":"A reconfigurable fault-tolerant routing algorithm to optimize the network-on-chip performance and latency in presence of intermittent and permanent faults","dc:creator":"Jabbarvand Behrouz R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","prism:issn":"10636404","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457719523"}],"prism:pageRange":"433-434","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2011.6081436","dc:description":"As the semiconductor industry advances to the deep sub-micron and nano technology points, the on-chip components are more prone to the defects during manufacturing and faults during system operation.

Surface characterization of the modified electrode was performed by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry. The investigations have been proved that the over-oxidation of the modifier film resulted in a porous thin layer that improves the interlayer diffusion mechanism for the electroactive species. On the other hand, the negative charge density on the surface of the electrode excludes the negative analytes (e.g. ascorbate and Fe(CN)63?/4?) and attracts the positive ones (e.g. dopamine and epinephrine). A remarkable enhancement in the microscopic area of the electrode resulted in a considerable increase of the peak current of epinephrine (EN) oxidation (?35 times). Differential pulse voltammetry has been applied as a very sensitive analytical method for the determination of sub-micromolar amounts of EN. Two linear ranges have been obtained for the EN concentration within the ranges of 0.1-8.0 and 10-100 μM. The voltammetric detection limit of the modified electrode for EN (based on 3σ) was 40 nM. On the other hand, this sensor has an excellent selectivity and sensitivity for the EN determination in the presence of clinical interferences (e.g. uric acid, ascorbic acid, and the human serum contents). The recovery for the EN determination in pharmaceutical injections was obtained as 96.4% with a RSD of 4.8%, based on 5 replicate determinations. These excellent properties make the prepared sensor suitable for the analysis of the trace amounts of EN in pharmaceutical and clinical preparations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The steel bars were austenitized at 900°C for 1h followed by intercritical annealing at 740°C for 100min and quenching into a salt bath with temperature of 300°C and holding at different times to obtain triple phase (TP) microstructures with 34vol.% fraction ferrite and various martensite (or bainite) contents. Presence of three phases in adjacent to each other was confirmed by metallographic analysis and TEM studies. TEM observation also indicates higher density of dislocations within ferrite near martensite colonies compared to that near the bainitic phases. Results of the tensile and hardness tests showed that with increasing martensite volume fraction, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and hardness increase which is related to higher martensite volume fraction, higher strength of ferrite and higher residual stresses. The increment of martensite volume fraction increased ductility in terms of uniform and total elongation and tensile fracture energy. This evidence is due to the change of martensite morphology, increase of dislocation density at interphase boundaries and increment in residual stresses of the ternary phase steel with increasing VM. Fracture surface micrographs of tensile specimens, examined by SEM and stereo optical microscopy, confirmed the reduction in ductility of TP steels with increasing VM. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25229399400","authid":"25229399400","authname":"Zare A.","surname":"Zare","given-name":"Ahmad","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56437485300","authid":"56437485300","authname":"Ekrami A.","surname":"Ekrami","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bainite | Ferrite | Martensite | Tensile properties | Triple phase steels","source-id":"17811","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053445725"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053445725?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80053445725&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80053445725&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022123611002928"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053445725","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80053445725","eid":"2-s2.0-80053445725","dc:title":"Conformal upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and Steklov problem","dc:creator":"Hassannezhad A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Functional Analysis","prism:issn":"00221236","prism:eIssn":"10960783","prism:volume":"261","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"3419-3436","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfa.2011.08.003","pii":"S0022123611002928","dc:description":"In this paper, we find upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the conformal class of a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g).

The proof relies on the construction of a suitable family of disjoint domains providing supports for a family of test functions. This method is interesting for itself and powerful.

Different GC × GC-TOFMS data slices acquired during the analysis of HFO samples and PAH standards were simultaneously analyzed using the MCR-ALS method to resolve the pure component elution profiles in the two chromatographic dimensions as well as their pure mass spectra. Outstandingly, retention time shifts within and between GC × GC runs were not affecting the results obtained using the proposed strategy and proper resolution of strongly coeluted compounds, baseline and background contributions was achieved. Calibration curves built up with standard samples of PAHs allowed the quantification of ten of them in HFO aromatic fractions. Relative errors in their estimated concentrations were in all cases below 6%.

The crystal structure and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles were characterized by XRD and VSM techniques, respectively.

The influence of pH value of the solution on the size distribution and hydrodynamic size of nanoparticles were studied by TEM and DLS methods, respectively.

pancyclicity property) has important applications in interconnection networks, parallel processing systems, and the implementation of a number of either computational or graph problems such as those used for finding storage schemes of logical data structures, layout of circuits in VLSI, etc. In this paper, we present the sufficient condition of the pancyclicity property of OTIS networks. The OTIS network (also referred to as two-level swapped network) is composed of n clones of an n-node original network constituting its clusters. It has received much attention due to its many favorable properties such as high degree of scalability, regularity, modularity, package-ability and high degree of algorithmic efficiency. Many properties of OTIS networks have been studied in the literature. In this work, we show that the OTIS networks have the pancyclicity property when the factor graph is Hamiltonian. More precisely, using a constructive method, we prove that if the factor graph G of an OTIS network contains cycles of length {3,4,5,l}, then all cycles of length {3,...,l2}, can be embedded in the OTIS-G network.

A new sensing circuit is proposed using a phase frequency detector for cognitive radio applications. Using this method, spectral sensing can be done in a very short time by a low cost, low power circuit, compared with available implemented methods. The PFD circuit resolves different frequencies without the need of variable filter bandwidth or the banks of filters. Also it accelerates sensing procedure because of short time needed to detect the signal. Simulations show the accurate operation of this method and comparison with other methods shows faster sweep rates. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032053","afid":"60032053","affilname":"Tarbiat Modares University","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24484044200","authid":"24484044200","authname":"Vahidpoor Z.","surname":"Vahidpoor","given-name":"Zeynab","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032053"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602304894","authid":"6602304894","authname":"Forooraghi K.","surname":"Forooraghi","given-name":"Keyvan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032053"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24467653900","authid":"24467653900","authname":"Atlasbaf Z.","surname":"Atlasbaf","given-name":"Zahra","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032053"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201643793","authid":"57201643793","authname":"Ahmadi A.","surname":"Ahmadi","given-name":"Ali Fotowat","initials":"A.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cognitive Radio (CR) | Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) | Spectrum Sensing","article-number":"6076394","source-id":"20700195009","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856294315"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856294315?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856294315&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856294315&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856294315","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84856294315","eid":"2-s2.0-84856294315","dc:title":"The operational and reservoir parameters influencing the performance of top-down in situ combustion in fractured reservoirs: 2D block-scale simulation of networked fractures","dc:creator":"Fatemi S.","prism:publicationName":"Petroleum Science and Technology","prism:issn":"10916466","prism:eIssn":"15322459","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"256-270","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"14 December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1080/10916466.2010.481647","dc:description":"Top-down in situ combustion (ISC) involves the stable propagation of a combustion front from the top vertical injector to the bottom horizontal producer. With the exception of laboratory studies of conventional sandstones, no application of the process in fractured carbonates has been addressed. The aim of the present work is to study ISC in the presence of a system of networked fractures using a thermal reservoir simulator from the Computer Modeling Group (CMG; Calgary, AB, Canada). The performance of ISC is compared with nonfractured system under similar conditions. To obtain more realistic results, a history-matched and validated combustion model of an Iranian naturally fractured low-permeability carbonate heavy oil reservoir, Kuh-E Mond, was used, and the performance of ISC in a fractured porous medium model was compared with a conventional (nonfractured) reservoir. Operational and reservoir parameters that may influence the performance of the process in the case of a fractured reservoir, such as air injection rate, initial oil saturation, initial water saturation, reservoir pressure, matrix permeability, vertical and horizontal fracture density, and the effect of water-oil capillary forces on the recovery of the process have been investigated. Simulation results showed that in the presence of fractures the recovery rate was slower compared to conventional model. Air breakthrough occurred at almost the same time in both models but the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas for the fractured model was quite high compared to the conventional model, which was near zero. The presence of fractures resulted in lower API gravity of the recovered oil; that is, upgrading of crude oil during the ISC process was lower for the fractured system. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015457","afid":"60015457","affilname":"University of Kansas, Lawrence","affiliation-city":"Lawrence","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011370","afid":"60011370","affilname":"Petroleum University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Iran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/50961200900","authid":"50961200900","authname":"Fatemi S.","surname":"Fatemi","given-name":"S.

This generalizes several classical problems, such as the minimum cost k-spanning tree problem, or k-MST (which is a (k, 1)-subgraph), and the minimum cost λ-edge-connected spanning subgraph (which is a (|V(G)|, λ)-subgraph). The only previously known results on this problem [L. C. Lau, J. S. Naor, M. R. Salavatipour, and M. Singh, SIAM J. Comput., 39 (2009), pp. 1062-1087], [C. Chekuri and N.
