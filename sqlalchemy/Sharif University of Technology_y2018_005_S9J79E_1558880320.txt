Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is one of the multicarrier modulation candidates proposed for the 5th generation of wireless networks. Among GFDM linear receivers, GFDM MMSE receiver achieves the best error performance for multipath fading channels at the cost of high numerical complexity. Hence, the combination of GFDM match filter (MF) receiver and double-side successive interference cancellation (DSIC) method is used instead. However, there is a significant gap between the error performance of GFDM MMSE and DSIC/MF receivers for the case of employing modern channel coding. Recently, we have proposed a new multicarrier scheme based on GFDM architecture called generalized orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (GOFDM). This study derives an optimized cyclic tree-structured perfect reconstruction-quadrature mirror filter (PR-QMF) bank for GOFDM transceiver and then introduces a novel method for implementation of the optimum filter bank in the frequency domain. Employing such a fast and optimum filter bank provides several advantages for GOFDM transceiver. GOFDM transmitter mitigates out-of-band spectrum leak to the level of that of GFDM. In addition, choosing an appropriate configuration of filter bank yields lower peak to average power ratio in transmit signal of GOFDM compared to that of OFDM. On the other hand, while GOFDM MMSE receiver has lower numerical complexity compared with GFDM DSIC/MF receiver, its coded bit error rate curve is close to that of GFDM MMSE receiver. The aforementioned advantages envision GOFDM as a competitive candidate to be employed in the physical layer of new wireless applications.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105242","afid":"60105242","affilname":"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017853","afid":"60017853","affilname":"Iranian Research Institute for Fundamental Sciences","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193926457","authid":"57193926457","authname":"Abbaszadeh M.","surname":"Abbaszadeh","given-name":"Mohammad Hadi","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105242"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/29467657300","authid":"29467657300","authname":"Khalaj B.","surname":"Khalaj","given-name":"Babak H.","initials":"B.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017853"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14048216800","authid":"14048216800","authname":"Haghbin A.","surname":"Haghbin","given-name":"Afrooz","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105242"}]}],"article-number":"12","source-id":"18202","fund-acr":"INSF","fund-no":"95824827","fund-sponsor":"Iran National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054195813"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054195813?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054195813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054195813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0753332218344810"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054195813","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054195813","eid":"2-s2.0-85054195813","dc:title":"Curcumin loading potentiates the neuroprotective efficacy of Fe <inf>3</inf> O <inf>4</inf> magnetic nanoparticles in cerebellum cells of schizophrenic rats","dc:creator":"Naserzadeh P.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy","prism:issn":"07533322","prism:eIssn":"19506007","prism:volume":"108","prism:pageRange":"1244-1252","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.106","pii":"S0753332218344810","dc:description":"© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS  Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs on isolated schizophrenia mitochondria of rats as an in vivo model. Methods: We designed CMN loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) (Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs) to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect. The physicochemical properties of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic laser light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential. Further, to prove Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs results in superior therapeutic effects, and also, the mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, mitochondrial complex II activity, reactive oxygen species generation, ATP level, cytochrome c release and histopathology of cerebellums were determined in brains of schizophrenic rats. Results: We showed that effective treatment with CMN reduced or prevented Fe 3 O 4 magnetic-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat brain probably, as well as mitochondrial complex II activity, MMP, and ATP level were remarkably reduced in the cerebellum mitochondria of treated group toward control (p < 0.05). Therewith, ROS generation, and cytochrome c release were notably (p < 0.05) increased in the cerebellum mitochondria of treated group compared with control group. Conclusion: Taken together, Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs exhibits potent antineurotoxicity activity in cerebellums of schizophrenic rats. This approach can be extended to preclinical and clinical use and may have importance in schizophernia treatment in the future. To our knowledge this is the first report that provides the Fe 3 O 4 magnetic- CurNPs could enhance the neuroprotective effects of CMN in the Schizophrenia.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation":

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which is classified into Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are among chronic gastrointestinal diseases with unknown pathogenesis. Diverse strategies have been applied for the treatment of this chronic disease. However, selective and site-specific routes of drug delivery to the inflamed location of the colon remain of high importance. Consequently, the application and effects of natural products in the form of nanoformulation and stimuli responsive nanoparticles as a novel strategy for the treatment of IBD are discussed in this review article. This approach may potentially overcome some complications that are associated with conventional means of colon drug delivery. Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo studies pave the way for understanding of the mechanism that lies behind this chronic relapsing disease and potentially more effective treatment.

Engineering hollow and porous platinum nanostructures using biomolecular templates is currently a significant focus for the enhancement of their facet-dependent optical, electronic, and electrocatalytic properties. However, remains a formidable challenge due to lack of appropriate biomolecules to have a structure-function relationship with nanocrystal facet development. Herein, human hemoglobin found to have facet-binding abilities that can control the morphology and optical properties of the platinum nanoclusters (Pt NCs) by regulation of the growth kinetics in alkaline media. Observations revealed the growth of unusual polyhedra by shape-directed nanocluster attachment along a certain orientation accompanied by Ostwald ripening and, in turn, yield well-dispersed hollow single-crystal nanotetrahedrons, which can easily self-aggregated and crystallized into porous and polycrystalline microspheres. The spontaneous, biobased organization of Pt NCs allow the intrinsic aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features in terms of the platinophilic interactions between Pt(II)-Hb complexes on the Pt(0) cores, thereby controlling the degree of aggregation and the luminescent intensity of Pt(0)@Pt(II)−Hb core−shell NCs. The Hb-Pt NCs exhibited high-performance electrocatalytic oxygen reduction providing a fundamental basis for outstanding catalytic enhancement of Hb-Pt catalysts based on morphology dependent and active site concentration for the four-electron reduction of oxygen. The as-prepared Hb-Pt NCs also exhibited high potential to use in cellular labeling and imaging thanks to the excellent photostability, chemical stability, and low cytotoxicity.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089143","afid":"60089143","affilname":"Iranian

The surface of nanoparticles (NPs) get coated by a wide range of biomolecules, upon exposure to biological fluids. It is now being increasingly accepted that NPs with particular physiochemical properties have a capacity to induce conformational changes to proteins and therefore influence their biological fates, we hypothesized that the gold NP’s metal surface may also be involved in the observed Fg unfolding and inflammatory response. To mechanistically test this hypothesis, we probed the interaction of Fg with gold surfaces using molecular dynamic simulation (MD) and revealed that the gold surface has a capacity to induce Fg conformational changes in favor of inflammation response. As the integrity of coatings at the surface of ultra-small gold NPs are not thorough, we also hypothesized that the ultra-small gold NPs have a capacity to induce unfolding of Fg regardless of the composition and surface charge of their coatings. Using different surface coatings at the surface of ultra-small gold NPs, we validated this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that gold NPs may cause unforeseen inflammatory effects, as their surface coatings may be degraded by physiological activity.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

Governance is key to tackling water challenges and transforming water management under the increasing pressures of competing water uses and climate change. Diverse water governance regimes have evolved in different countries and regions to regulate the development and management of water resources and the provision of water services. Scholars and policy analysts have been comparing these water governance regimes to analyze elements and processes, to assess performance, or to draw lessons. Although the number of such studies has increased since the 1980s, no comprehensive synthesis exists. We present such a synthesis by conducting a systematic review of the emerging field of comparative water governance studies, and we critically reflect on how water governance is defined, conceptualized, and assessed in different contexts. Based on the resultant insights, we identify four areas for future research: (1) improving the balance between small-, medium-, and large-N studies that are used in comparative studies of water governance; (2) conducting longitudinal comparisons of water governance to identify temporal governance trends and patterns; (3) expanding the geographical coverage of the comparisons to include underrepresented countries and regions, focusing more broadly on the global South; and (4) addressing the issues of justice, equity, and power, which are becoming increasingly important in tackling the water governance challenges that are exacerbated by the effects of climate change, industrialization, and urbanization.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60075693","afid":"60075693","affilname":"Leibniz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF) e.

Data sampled at discrete times appears as a succession of discontinuous jumps, even if the underlying trajectory is continuous. We analytically derive a criterion that allows one to check whether for a given, even noisy time series the underlying process has a continuous (diffusion) trajectory or has jump discontinuities. This enables one to detect and characterize abrupt changes (jump events) in given time series. The proposed criterion is validated numerically using synthetic continuous and discontinuous time series.

These alternative binders use a wide range of aluminosilicate precursors, with differing availabilities, reactivities, costs and CO2 emissions. Despite all the studies published on improving the characteristics of these materials in the last decades, some aspects of alkali-activated binders require further investigations. For instance, shrinkage in alkali-activated binders due to the different chemical processes being involved is more complicated than OPC composites and it plays a key role in long-term performance. However, information on the shrinkage behavior of these binder systems is scattered and fragmented. Therefore, this review critically surveys the drying shrinkage behavior of alkali-activated binders with slag, fly ash and metakaolin. The mechanisms of the drying shrinkage and the factors that affect shrinkage are discussed. Different solutions to limit the shrinkage are also presented. Then, an analysis is conducted based on the literature, and the main chemical elements affecting the drying shrinkage of alkali-activated materials are proposed. Finally, the feasibility of using the developed empirical models for predicting the drying shrinkage of OPC concretes is also investigated for alkali activated binders. This review shows that alkali-activated slag binders generally have the higher rate of the drying shrinkage compared to other alkali activated binders, albeit, reinforcing the plain compositions with fibers, using expanding admixtures, curing at elevated temperatures, using a combination of slag with fly ash or metakaolin reduces successfully the drying shrinkage. Moreover, utilizing ternary diagrams, it is revealed that the molar ratio of Ca/Si has the greatest impact on the rate of drying shrinkage in the alkali-activated binders.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026420","afid":"60026420","affilname":"Lorestan University","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56039394000","authid":"56039394000","authname":"Mastali M.","surname":"Mastali","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26432103500","authid":"26432103500","authname":"Kinnunen P.","surname":"Kinnunen","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56071109300","authid":"56071109300","authname":"Dalvand A.","surname":"Dalvand","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203984867","authid":"57203984867","authname":"Mohammadi Firouz R.","surname":"Mohammadi Firouz","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14622629900","authid":"14622629900","authname":"Illikainen M.","surname":"Illikainen","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alkali-activated binders | Drying shrinkage | Geopolymers | Influential factors | Mechanism","source-id":"24443","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053803184"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053803184?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053803184&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053803184&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0950061818322657"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053803184","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85053803184","eid":"2-s2.0-85053803184","dc:title":"The effect of elevated temperatures on the tensile performance of GFRP and CFRP sheets","dc:creator":"Jarrah M.","prism:publicationName":"Construction and Building Materials","prism:issn":"09500618","prism:volume":"190","prism:pageRange":"38-52","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.086","pii":"S0950061818322657","dc:description":"© 2018 In this study, the effects of fiber type (i.e., carbon and glass fibers) and intumescent paint on the tensile performance of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets at elevated temperatures are investigated. For this purpose, a series of tensile tests were conducted on the glass and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP and CFRP) sheets, with and without intumescent fire retardant paint, at different elevated temperatures. The studied temperatures ranged from 25 °C to 600 °C. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to examine the effects of elevated temperatures on FRP sheets and the fire protecting mechanism of the intumescent paint. Based on the test results, the tensile strength of the FRP sheets decreased significantly after exposure to high temperatures so that GFRP and CFRP sheets lost about 87% and 67% of their tensile strength at 600 °C. However, the corresponding specimens that were coated with intumescent paint experienced lower tensile strength reductions (i.e., 62% and 60% for the GFRP and CFRP sheets, respectively, at 600 °C). Finally, predictive models were proposed for the tensile performance of sheets at elevated temperatures based on Bayesian linear regressions conducted on the experimental data.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019578","afid":"60019578","affilname":"Monash University","affiliation-city":"Melbourne","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001784","afid":"60001784","affilname":"Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203960596","authid":"57203960596","authname":"Jarrah M.","surname":"Jarrah","given-name":"Majid","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195959589","authid":"57195959589","authname":"Najafabadi E.","surname":"Najafabadi","given-name":"Esmaeil Pournamazian","initials":"E.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202719305","authid":"57202719305","authname":"Khaneghahi M.","surname":"Khaneghahi","given-name":"Mohammad Houshmand","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36460074900","authid":"36460074900","authname":"Oskouei A.","surname":"Oskouei","given-name":"Asghar Vatani","initials":"A.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001784"}]}],"authkeywords":"CFRP | Elevated temperatures | Fire protection | Fire retardant Materials | FRP sheets | GFRP | Intumescent paint","source-id":"24443","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054768009"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054768009?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054768009&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054768009&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378775318310796"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054768009","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054768009","eid":"2-s2.0-85054768009","dc:title":"The synergistic effect of dimethyl sulfoxide vapor treatment and C <inf>60</inf> electron transporting layer towards enhancing current collection in mixed-ion inverted perovskite solar cells","dc:creator":"Saki Z.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Power Sources","prism:issn":"03787753","prism:volume":"405","prism:pageRange":"70-79","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.100","pii":"S0378775318310796","dc:description":"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.  Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been introduced as better candidate for roll-to-roll printing and scale-up than their conventional configuration counterparts, while their fabrication is technically more demanding. The common light absorbing layer in inverted PSCs is the single cation methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite, whereas mixed-ion perovskites are chemically more stable. In mixed-ion perovskites, where FA (formamidinium) is the main replacement for MA, the electron affinity is larger than in MAPbI 3 perovskites, leading to possible barriers against photoelectron collection by the electron transporting layer (ETL). In this paper we report on a mixed-ion (FAPbI 3 ) 0.83 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.17 inverted PSC with improved photocurrent through using a dimethyl sulfoxide vapor treatment of perovskite layer and replacing the conventional [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM) with C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP) as more effective ETL. The treatment of perovskite layer results in reduction of impurity phases of δ-FAPbI 3 and PbI 2 . Photoluminescence and open circuit voltage decay data demonstrate better charge carrier collection by the C 60 /BCP compared to the PC 70 BM ETL, and an electron barrier for the back flow of electrons from ETL to perovskite. Our improvements in perovskite crystalization and electron transfer layer simultaneously lead to increasing the current density from 10 to 21 mA cm −2 .","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa":

Autoencoder, at the heart of a deep learning structure, plays an important role in extracting abstract representation of a set of input training patterns. Abstract representation contains informative features to demonstrate a large set of data patterns in an optimal way in certain applications. It is shown that through sparse regularization of outputs of the hidden units (codes) in an autoencoder, the quality of codes can be enhanced that leads to a higher learning performance in applications like classification. Almost all methods trying to achieve code sparsity in an autoencoder use a smooth approximation of `1 norm, as the best convex approximation of pseudo `0 norm. In this paper, we incorporate sparsity to autoencoder training optimization process using non-smooth convex `1 norm and propose an efficient algorithm to train the structure. The non-smooth `1 regularization have shown its efficiency in imposing sparsity in various applications including feature selection via lasso and sparse representation using basis pursuit. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show superiority of this term in training a sparse autoencoder over previously proposed ones. As a byproduct of the proposed method, it can also be used to apply different types of non-smooth regularizers to autoencoder training problem.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207723387","authid":"57207723387","authname":"Amini S.","surname":"Amini","given-name":"Sajjad","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004670846","authid":"7004670846","authname":"Ghaemmaghami S.","surname":"Ghaemmaghami","given-name":"Shahrokh","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"article-number":"8553217","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055583209"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055583209?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055583209&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055583209&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0360319918331367"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055583209","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055583209","eid":"2-s2.0-85055583209","dc:title":"Improved H<inf>2</inf> production from the APR of polyols in a microreactor utilizing Pt supported on a CeO<inf>2</inf>–Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> structured catalyst","dc:creator":"Entezary B.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","prism:issn":"03603199","prism:pageRange":"21777-21790","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.207","pii":"S0360319918331367","dc:description":"© 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC In this research, the activity and selectivity of a platinum-based catalyst for H2 production through aqueous phase reforming (APR) in a fixed-bed reactor (FBR) as well as, a structured catalyst microreactor (MR) were investigated. In this venue, first, an in-house designed MR was fabricated and the catalytic material was deposited on the channel walls of this steel made reactor. After verification of the stability of the coated layer, the prepared reactor was employed to investigate the APR reaction. In this regard, APR of the ethylene glycol and glycerol over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst were conducted in an MR and FBR. Obtained results demonstrated that employing Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 as a highly active catalyst in an FBR, slightly reduced the H2 selectivity for the APR reaction of the ethylene glycol. Moreover, this effect appeared even more pronounced in reforming of glycerol. On the other hand, utilization of an MR for the APR of glycerol improved the H2 selectivity due to the more active Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst, for this process. Comparison of the results revealed that the highly active catalyst alongside a reactor alleviating mass transfer limitations were two complementary factors leading to better performance of such chemical systems. Moreover, this research emphasized that obtained values of the APR conversion and H2 selectivity in an MR coated with the Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst was superior to those obtained from an FBR. Ultimately, the best results obtained for the aforementioned catalytic species indicated that the APR of glycerol in a structured catalyst MR led to 75.3% conversion of glycerol and 92.4% selectivity to hydrogen production both of which were considerably better than results determined in an FBR.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204419948","authid":"57204419948","authname":"Entezary B.","surname":"Entezary","given-name":"Behzad","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603908012","authid":"6603908012","authname":"Kazemeini M.","surname":"Kazemeini","given-name":"Mohammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aqueous phase reforming | Ethylene glycol | Glycerol | Microreactor | Pt-based catalyst | Structured catalyst","source-id":"26991","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057896244"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057896244?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057896244&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057896244&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057896244","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057896244","eid":"2-s2.0-85057896244","dc:title":"Cold standby renewal process integrated with environmental factor effects for reliability evaluation of multiple autonomous robot system","dc:creator":"Fazlollahtabar H.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management","prism:issn":"0265671X","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"2450-2464","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1108/IJQRM-08-2017-0160","dc:description":"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the required number of robots consisting of some non-repairable components, by employing a renewal model. Considering the importance of the availability of standby autonomous robots for reducing and preventing down-times of advanced production systems, which imposes a considerable loss, the present research tries to introduce a practical model for the determination of the required number of autonomous robots. Design/methodology/approach: Most of the available research on the estimation of the required standby components based on the reliability characteristics of components has not considered the environmental factors influencing the reliability characteristics. Therefore, such estimations are not accurate enough. In contrast, this paper focuses on the influence of the environmental and human factors (e.g. the operators’ skill) on the robot reliability characteristics. Findings: A model based on the Weibull renewal process combined with the cold standby strategy is developed for reliability evaluation of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated reliability evaluation model is worked out in some cases. Originality/value: Determining a required number of robots is an important issue in availability and utilization of a complex robotic production system. In an advanced production system, while the estimation process of a required number of robots can be performed through different approaches, one of the realistic estimation methods is based on the system’s reliability that takes into consideration the system operating environment. To forecast the required number of robots for an existing production system, in some cases, the assumption of a constant failure rate does not differ much from the assumption of a non-constant failure rate and can be made with an acceptable error.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112569521","afid":"112569521","affilname":"National Elites Foundation of Iran","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26032532700","authid":"26032532700","authname":"Fazlollahtabar H.","surname":"Fazlollahtabar","given-name":"Hamed","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112569521"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193316997","authid":"57193316997","authname":"Niaki S.","surname":"Niaki","given-name":"Seyed Taghi Akhavan","initials":"S.T.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cold standby | Environmental factors | Multiple autonomous robots | Reliability evaluation | Renewal process","source-id":"144740","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Iran's National Elites Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059821427"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059821427?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059821427&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059821427&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059821427","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059821427","eid":"2-s2.0-85059821427","dc:title":"Iterative reconstruction of spectrally sparse signals from level crossings","dc:creator":"Mashhadi M.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789082797015"}],"prism:volume":"2018-September","prism:pageRange":"435-439","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553367","dc:description":"© EURASIP 2018.

Similar to the ZC case, we propose a system of simultaneously constrained signed-CS problems to reconstruct a sparse signal from its Level Crossings (LC)s and modify both the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) and BSL0 algorithms to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed LC reconstruction techniques in comparison with the literature.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105213","afid":"60105213","affilname":"Qom University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Qum","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016005","afid":"60016005","affilname":"Queen's University, Kingston","affiliation-city":"Kingston","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56544260200","authid":"56544260200","authname":"Mashhadi M.","surname":"Mashhadi","given-name":"Mahdi Boloursaz","initials":"M.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23398930800","authid":"23398930800","authname":"Zayyani H.","surname":"Zayyani","given-name":"Hadi","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105213"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56224678400","authid":"56224678400","authname":"Gazor S.","surname":"Gazor","given-name":"Saeed","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005676504","authid":"7005676504","authname":"Marvasti F.","surname":"Marvasti","given-name":"Farokh","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"article-number":"8553367","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059817096"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059817096?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059817096&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059817096&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059817096","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059817096","eid":"2-s2.0-85059817096","dc:title":"Joint low mutual and average coherence dictionary learning","dc:creator":"Parsa J.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789082797015"}],"prism:volume":"2018-September","prism:pageRange":"1725-1729","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553417","dc:description":"© EURASIP 2018. Dictionary learning (DL) has found many applications in sparse approximation problems. Two important properties of a dictionary are maximum and average coherence (cross-correlation) between its atoms. Many algorithms have been presented to take into account the coherence between atoms during dictionary learning. Some of them mainly reduce the maximum (mutual) coherence whereas some other algorithms decrease the average coherence. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly reduce the maximum and average correlations between different atoms. This is done by making a balance between reducing the maximum and average coherences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduce the mutual and average coherence of the dictionary better than existing algorithms.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104653","afid":"60104653","affilname":"Universite Grenoble Alpes","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205379577","authid":"57205379577","authname":"Parsa J.","surname":"Parsa","given-name":"Javad","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55907637700","authid":"55907637700","authname":"Sadeghi M.","surname":"Sadeghi","given-name":"Mostafa","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506573522","authid":"6506573522","authname":"Babaie-Zadeh M.","surname":"Babaie-Zadeh","given-name":"Massoud","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55138338400","authid":"55138338400","authname":"Jutten C.","surname":"Jutten","given-name":"Christian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Average coherence | Compressed sensing | Dictionary learning | Mutual coherence | Sparse coding","article-number":"8553417","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"96000780","fund-sponsor":"Iran National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822268"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822268?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059822268&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059822268&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822268","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059822268","eid":"2-s2.0-85059822268","dc:title":"Controllability Analysis of Threshold Graphs and Cographs","dc:creator":"Mousavi S.","prism:publicationName":"2018 European Control Conference, ECC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783952426982"}],"prism:pageRange":"1869-1874","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"27 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.23919/ECC.2018.8550153","dc:description":"© 2018 European Control Association (EUCA).

In the dynamic setting, unlike the existing works, we consider non-myopic players who are attempting to maximize their long-run incentives.

Nevertheless, there have been inadequate studies in the literature which tackle the many aspects of this important type of foundation. In this paper, a new and simple approach is presented for estimating group efficiency of drilled shafts installed in sandy soil under axial loading. This approach may prove handy for geotechnical practitioners in their pile group design decisions. The distinguishing point about this approach is its being less-conservative in comparison with the rather few previous equations available in the literature. The mathematical approach derived in this study is based on results from numerical modelling using ABAQUS software. Validity of the modelling approach was verified by comparing the results from the numerical simulation with those from full-scale load tests. Then, parameters governing single shafts and group behaviour were studied. The two factors which can influence group efficiency are arrangement of the bored piles (number of piles) and spacing.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030398","afid":"60030398","affilname":"Temple University","affiliation-city":"Philadelphia","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56880968700","authid":"56880968700","authname":"Ahmadi M.","surname":"Ahmadi","given-name":"Mohammad Mehdi","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190858991","authid":"57190858991","authname":"Mahvelati S.","surname":"Mahvelati","given-name":"Siavash","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030398"}]}],"authkeywords":"Axial loading | Bored piles | Drilled shaft | Group efficiency | Numerical modelling | Sandy soils","source-id":"21100371227","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059777112"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059777112?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059777112&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059777112&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059777112","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059777112","eid":"2-s2.0-85059777112","dc:title":"Compressed Video Watermarking for Authentication and Reconstruction of the Audio Part","dc:creator":"Esmaeilbeig Z.","prism:publicationName":"2018 15th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, ISCISC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538675823"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2018.8546897","dc:description":"© 2018 IEEE. This paper is concerned with designing a digital video watermarking system capable of authenticating and reconstructing the audio part of the video after possible attacks. As recompression is the most common attack on videos, we attempt to improve robustness of one of the recently presented and successful compressed video water-marking schemes against recompression. A comprehensive set of experiments are conducted to show that our watermarking scheme is robust against recompression attack and enables reconstruction of audio part with an acceptable quality based on PESQ score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses the visual part of a video as a watermarking cover signal for tampering detection and reconstruction of the audio part. We specifically address videos with important audio content, e.g., news, reports, etc.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205360431","authid":"57205360431","authname":"Esmaeilbeig Z.","surname":"Esmaeilbeig","given-name":"Zahra","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004670846","authid":"7004670846","authname":"Ghaemmaghami S.","surname":"Ghaemmaghami","given-name":"Shahrokh","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"audio authentication | Digital watermarking | robust watermarking | video compression | video forensics","article-number":"8546897","source-id":"21100894505","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059766304"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059766304?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059766304&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059766304&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059766304","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059766304","eid":"2-s2.0-85059766304","dc:title":"Tampering Detection and Restoration of Compressed Video","dc:creator":"Azizian B.","prism:publicationName":"2018 15th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, ISCISC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538675823"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2018.8546848","dc:description":"© 2018 IEEE. This paper presents a method to detect tampering of video data and then restore an approximate version of its original contents in compressed H.264/AVC domain using watermarking. In the proposed scheme, a low resolution image from a number of video frames in certain time slots are embedded into the DCT coefficients of the other parts of the video which are adequately far from the reference frames. For detecting temporal/spatial tampering, the index of each frame/macroblock is embedded into itself as an authentication code. If a malicious tampering is detected at the authentication phase, the information used for restoration is extracted to recover the original contents in the altered areas. The extracted images are post-processed to enhance the image quality that could have been affected by channel errors or attacks. Our method provides appropriate transparency and robustness despite large volume of the payload to be handled. The results show that the BER of the watermark signal for recompression attack is about 4.5% on average under QP=24. The main achievement of the proposed watermarking system is the restoration of tampered areas, in addition to high accuracy in detecting malicious tampering in H.264/AVC domain.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56612011000","authid":"56612011000","authname":"Azizian B.","surname":"Azizian","given-name":"Bardia","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004670846","authid":"7004670846","authname":"Ghaemmaghami S.","surname":"Ghaemmaghami","given-name":"Shahrokh","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"digital forensics | H.264/AVC standard | video authentication | video self-recovery | watermarking","article-number":"8546848","source-id":"21100894505","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059949073"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059949073?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059949073&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059949073&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059949073","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059949073","eid":"2-s2.0-85059949073","dc:title":"Optimal distributed generation allocation and sizing for minimizing losses and cost function","dc:creator":"Mokhtari N.","prism:publicationName":"2018 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, IAS 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538645369"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/IAS.2018.8544588","dc:description":"© 2018 IEEE The need for independent power generation has been increased in recent years specially with the growing demand in micro grid systems. In distribution networks with several DGs of different types and with all kinds of loads of variable nature, an optimal power balance in the system has to be achieved. This optimal objective, which results in minimal energy losses over a specific period of time, requires an optimal location and sizing of the DGs in a distribution network. This paper proposes a new optimization method in which both optimal location of the DGs and their generation profile according to the load demand profile are determined. The method is based on minimizing simultaneously the cost of investment and operation of the DGs, the cost of power delivered by the external grid as well as the cost of power losses in the network. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE standard radial distribution network considering time-varying loads.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923","afid":"60004923","affilname":"North Carolina State University","affiliation-city":"Raleigh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205421133","authid":"57205421133","authname":"Mokhtari N.","surname":"Mokhtari","given-name":"Niloofar Ghanbari H.","initials":"N.G.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004923"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404284094","authid":"7404284094","authname":"Bhattacharya S.","surname":"Bhattacharya","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004923"}]}],"authkeywords":"Distributed Generation (DG) | Energy losses | Load profile | Optimal placement | Time-varying loads","article-number":"8544588","source-id":"21100894616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059756010"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059756010?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059756010&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059756010&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059756010","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059756010","eid":"2-s2.0-85059756010","dc:title":"BLProM: Business-Layer Process Miner of the Web Application","dc:creator":"Alidoosti M.","prism:publicationName":"2018 15th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, ISCISC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538675823"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2018.8546899","dc:description":"© 2018 IEEE. Web application vulnerability scanners cannot detect business logic vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities related to logic) because they are not able to understand business logic of the web application. In order to identify business logic of the web application, this paper presents BLProM, the black box approach that identifies business processes of the web application. Detecting business processes of the web applications can be used in dynamic security testing to determine business logic vulnerabilities in the web applications. BLProM first extracts navigation graph of the web application then identifies business processes from the navigation graph. The evaluation conducted on three well-known open source web applications shows that BLProM is able to detect business logic processes. Experimental results show that BLProM improves web application scanning because it clusters web application pages and prevent scanning similar pages. The proposed approach is compared to OWASP ZAP, an open source web scanner. We show that BLProM improves web application scanning about % 96.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005710","afid":"60005710","affilname":"Malek Ashtar University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55912535900","authid":"55912535900","authname":"Alidoosti M.","surname":"Alidoosti","given-name":"Mitra","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005710"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57052772700","authid":"57052772700","authname":"Nowroozi A.","surname":"Nowroozi","given-name":"Alireza","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Business layer | business process | navigation graph","article-number":"8546899","source-id":"21100894505","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059739347"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059739347?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059739347&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059739347&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059739347","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059739347","eid":"2-s2.0-85059739347","dc:title":"A Practical and Secure Lattice-based Scheme for Full-Duplex Gaussian One-Way Relay Channels","dc:creator":"Khodaiemehr H.","prism:publicationName":"2018 15th International ISC (Iranian Society of Cryptology) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, ISCISC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538675823"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCISC.2018.8546937","dc:description":"© 2018 IEEE. Unidirectional or one-way relaying, where two wireless nodes, each of which would like to create an in- formation flow from one node to the other one via a single decode-and-forward (DF) relay, has been an active area of recent research. We consider an additional secrecy constraint for protection against an honest but curious relay. Indeed, while the relay should decode the source message, it should be fully ignorant of the message content. We provide a secure lattice coding strategy based on quasi-cyclic low-density parity check (QC-LDPC) lattice codes for unidirectional Gaussian relay channels. QC-LDPC lattice codes are carved from infinite QC- LDPC lattices using a shaping algorithm. Due to the existence of low-overhead encoding and decoding algorithms, these lattice codes can be implemented practically in high dimensions. Our proposed scheme combines a Rao-Nam like encryption with a new DF relaying scheme for QC-LDPC lattice codes. Some chosen-plaintext attacks and recent attacks on the Rao- Nam like schemes are considered over the proposed scheme. Due to its low overhead encryption-decryption algorithms, the proposed scheme can be employed efficiently in high information rates. According to our simulation results, the proposed relaying scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of error performance, efficiency and security.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016248","afid":"60016248","affilname":"K.
