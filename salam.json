The effect of Pd and Au additives on gas sensing properties of SnO 2 was investigated. SnO 2 pallets were fabricated and sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 90 minutes. Several nanometer layers of Pd and Au were deposited on separate SnO 2 pallets and were intentionally dispersed into the SnO 2 pallets by long heat treatment (400 \u00b0C for 1 Day). All metal loaded samples showed significant enhancement in response level and optimum operating temperature compare to pure SnO 2 gas sensors. The amount of enhancement was strongly dependent on the material and the thickness of deposited metal layer. Studying butanol response showed that increasing the thickness of metal causes the response level to increase. Further thickness increase caused contrary effect and decreased the performance of sensors. Best results were achieved at 10 nm-thick Au and 7 nm-thick Pd. Generally, Pd-SnO 2 samples demonstrated better performance than Au-SnO 2 ones, however, Au-SnO 2 samples were proved to be good candidate to sense reducing gases with lower hydrogen atoms in their formula. Given experimental results were also good evidence of chemical activity of gold and simply confirms the relation between chemical activity and gold particle size.

This study presents design, micro-fabrication and neural network calibration of a low cost micro-gas sensor. This sensor is able to identify two gases (CO and H2) and their concentrations in a mixture. Using the micro-fabrication process the sensitivity of the sensors has increased while decreasing the fabrication cost. Using the Pechini route technique, the sensing layer is fabricated based on a layer of metal oxide semiconductor (SnO2) which is doped with palladium.

The non-linearity produces cross-correlation among the subcarriers and results in deteriorating the OFDMA subcarriers orthogonality. Hence, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the output signal of PA for OFDMA signal with different power scaling factors for subcarriers is derived. Then, the theoretical SIR is verified by simulation result. Next, the optimisation problem is designed to maximise the total achievable downlink rate of all users by assigning subcarriers and power scaling factors. This non-convex problem is solved by comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation.

Wide-spread deployment ofWireless Sensor Networks (WSN) necessitates special attention to security issues, amongst which Sybil attacks are the most important ones. As a core to Sybil attacks, malicious nodes try to disrupt network operations by creating several fabricated IDs. Due to energy consumption concerns in WSNs, devising detection algorithms which release the sensor nodes from high computational and communicational loads are of great importance. In this paper, a new computationally lightweight watchdog-based algorithm is proposed for detecting Sybil IDs in mobile WSNs. The proposed algorithm employs watchdog nodes for collecting detection information and a designated watchdog node for detection information processing and the final Sybil list generation. Benefiting from a newly devised co-presence state diagram and adequate detection rules, the new algorithm features low extra communication overhead, as well as a satisfactory compromise between two otherwise contradictory detection measures of performance, True Detection Rate (TDR) and False Detection Rate (FDR).

The rock materials surrounding the underground excavations typically demonstrate nonlinear mechanical response and irreversible behavior in particular under high in-situ stress states. The dominant causes of irreversible behavior are plastic flow and damage process. The plastic flow is controlled by the presence of local shear stresses which cause the frictional sliding. During this process, the net number of bonds remains unchanged practically. The overall macroscopic consequence of plastic flow is that the elastic properties (e.g. the stiffness of the material) are insensitive to this type of irreversible change. The main cause of irreversible changes in quasi-brittle materials such as rock is the damage process occurring within the material. From a microscopic viewpoint, damage initiates with the nucleation and growth of microcracks. When the microcracks length reaches a critical value, the coalescence of them occurs and finally, the localized meso-cracks appear. The macroscopic and phenomenological consequence of damage process is stiffness degradation, dilatation and softening response. In this paper, a coupled elastoplastic-logarithmic damage model was used to simulate the irreversible deformations and stiffness degradation of rock materials under loading. In this model, damage evolution & plastic flow rules were formulated in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics principles. To take into account the stiffness degradation and softening on post-peak region, logarithmic damage variable was implemented. Also, a plastic model with Drucker-Prager yield function was used to model plastic strains. Then, an algorithm was proposed to calculate the numerical steps based on the proposed coupled plastic and damage constitutive model. The developed model has been programmed in VC++ environment. Then, it was used as a separate and new constitutive model in DEM code (UDEC). Finally, the experimental Oolitic limestone rock behavior was simulated based on the developed model. The irreversible strains, softening and stiffness degradation were reproduced in the numerical results. Furthermore, the confinement pressure dependency of rock behavior was simulated in according to experimental observations.", "citedby-count": "0", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751", "afid": "60007751", "affilname": "Amirkabir University of Technology", "affiliation-city": "Tehran", "affiliation-country": "Iran"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "$": "3"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200335651", "authid": "57200335651", "authname": "Abdia M.", "surname": "Abdia", "given-name": "M.", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007751"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36925647500", "authid": "36925647500", "authname": "Molladavoodi H.", "surname": "Molladavoodi", "given-name": "H.", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007751"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6503856204", "authid": "6503856204", "authname": "Salarirad H.", "surname": "Salarirad", "given-name": "H.", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007751"}]}], "authkeywords": "Brittleness parameter | Damage mechanics | Logarithmic damage variable | Plasticity | Stiffness degradation", "source-id": "18951", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "1", "openaccessFlag": true}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039067408"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039067408?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85039067408&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85039067408&origin=inward"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039067408", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85039067408", "eid": "2-s2.0-85039067408", "dc:title": "Comparison of transformer modeling on riser pole arresters behavior during switching transients", "dc:creator": "Abbaszadeh A.", "prism:publicationName": "Archives of Electrical Engineering", "prism:issn": "14274221", "prism:eIssn": "23002506", "prism:volume": "66", "prism:issueIdentifier": "4", "prism:pageRange": "717-730", "prism:coverDate": "2017-12-20", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "20 December 2017", "prism:doi": "10.1515/aee-2017-0054", "dc:description": "\u00a9 Polish Academy of Sciences 2017.

High torque density at low speed is one of the main characteristics of applications such as wind turbines and traction systems. Permanent magnet transverse flux machines exhibit this features owing to their high-energy magnetic flux, which is normal to current and motion vector. The machine's specific geometry magnifies cogging torque that further increases torque ripple, noise, and mechanical vibrations.

Pattern recognition techniques are appropriate methods for high-dimensional data such as geochemical data. Evaluation of the geochemical distribution of rare earth elements (REEs) requires the use of such methods. In particular, the multivariate nature of REE data makes them a good target for numerical analysis. The main subject of this paper is application of unsupervised pattern recognition approaches in evaluating geochemical distribution of REEs in the Kiruna type magnetite-apatite deposit of Se-Chahun. For this purpose, 42 bulk lithology samples were collected from the Se-Chahun iron ore deposit. In this study, 14 rare earth elements were measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Pattern recognition makes it possible to evaluate the relations between the samples based on all these 14 features, simultaneously. In addition to providing easy solutions, discovery of the hidden information and relations of data samples is the advantage of these methods. Therefore, four clustering methods (unsupervised pattern recognition) - including a modified basic sequential algorithmic scheme (MBSAS), hierarchical (agglomerative) clustering, <i>k</i>-means clustering and self-organizing map (SOM) - were applied and results were evaluated using the silhouette criterion. Samples were clustered in four types. Finally, the results of this study were validated with geological facts and analysis results from, for example, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ICP-MS and optical mineralogy. The results of the <i>k</i>-means clustering and SOM methods have the best matches with reality, with experimental studies of samples and with field surveys. Since only the rare earth elements are used in this division, a good agreement of the results with lithology is considerable. It is concluded that the combination of the proposed methods and geological studies leads to finding some hidden information, and this approach has the best results compared to using only one of them.", "citedby-count": "0", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751", "afid": "60007751", "affilname": "Amirkabir University of Technology", "affiliation-city": "Tehran", "affiliation-country": "Iran"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "$": "2"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55321411700", "authid": "55321411700", "authname": "Sarparandeh M.", "surname": "Sarparandeh", "given-name": "Mohammadali", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007751"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12795689200", "authid": "12795689200", "authname": "Hezarkhani A.", "surname": "Hezarkhani", "given-name": "Ardeshir", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007751"}]}], "source-id": "21100405022", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "1", "openaccessFlag": true}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030830424"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030830424?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030830424&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030830424&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0021999117306575"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030830424", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85030830424", "eid": "2-s2.0-85030830424", "dc:title": "The use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) meshless RBF-FD technique to simulate the shallow water equations", "dc:creator": "Dehghan M.", "prism:publicationName": "Journal of Computational Physics", "prism:issn": "00219991", "prism:eIssn": "10902716", "prism:volume": "351", "prism:pageRange": "478-510", "prism:coverDate": "2017-12-15", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "15 December 2017", "prism:doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2017.09.007", "pii": "S0021999117306575", "dc:description": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, based on the proper orthogonal decomposition approach we want to construct a fast meshless method. To this end, we consider shallow water models and obtain a suitable time-discrete scheme based on the predictor-corrector technique.

The method approximates the solution using the radial basis function (RBF) expansion with polynomial precision in the discrete collocation method. The collocation method for solving logarithmic boundary integral equations encounters more difficulties for computing the singular integrals which cannot be approximated by the classical quadrature formulae. To overcome this problem, we utilize the non-uniform composite Gauss\u2013Legendre integration rule and employ it to estimate the singular logarithm integrals appeared in the method. Since the scheme is based on the use of scattered points spread on the analyzed domain and does not need any domain elements, we can call it as the meshless discrete collocation method.

The solution procedure is presented in two steps. Firstly, the elastic bending of simply supported FG plates is studied to find the deflection and stress distribution. Until this step, the mechanical properties are assumed to vary through the thickness following the rule of mixture. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from quasi 3D elasticity and various shear deformation theories and there has been an excellent agreement between them. In the next step, the mechanical properties of FG plates are determined by using TTO model as the modified rule of mixture. The volume fraction of material constituents is assumed to vary via a power-law function through the thickness in both steps. Finally, Tresca and Von Mises\u2019 yield criteria are utilized to predict the onset of yielding.

Hence, uncertain resources will be penalized if they create an imbalance in power generation. Both of the positive and negative imbalances will lead to a decrease in the uncertain resources' profitability. In the market environment, when the time is close to the real operation, the excess generation could not be sold. In some markets, the system operator buys the excess renewable generation by penalty factors. Furthermore, the insufficient generation must be compensated through buying from the spot market which has higher prices. The owners of uncertain resources want to have coordinated operation with storage units to mitigate the risk of commitment in the electricity market and to be protected from high prices of the spot market in case of their inaccurate forecasting.

The integrality constraints of the subproblem are relaxed and the relaxed problem is solved in a branch-and-bound framework, where in each node, the Benders algorithm is applied between the master problem and the relaxed subproblem. Benders cuts generated in a node of the branch-and bound tree are proved to be valid for all its descendants, but they are not necessarily valid for the non-descendant nodes. These cuts, referred to as local cuts, can be used to warm start the master problem of each descendant node, thus leading to better initial bounds. Furthermore, a novel way is presented for defining the local cuts in a general form. This general form is in fact a function of the subproblems\u2019 variables and enables us to reuse the generated (local) cuts in the whole tree by updating some values of the function.

The results obtained from SEM images revealed a growth of granular structures and then formation of larger sized agglomerates on the surface of thin films, with an increase in number of shots.
